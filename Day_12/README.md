## Day 12 – Open Source Exploration

- Explored Flask open-source repository
- Learned how to find and evaluate beginner-friendly issues
- Selected a documentation issue related to HTTP 415 errors
- Commented on the issue before starting work
- Located the relevant documentation section
- Added a clarification note explaining 415 Unsupported Media Type for JSON requests
- Opened my first Pull Request to an open-source project

Key learning:
Understanding the open-source contribution workflow is more important than
deep technical knowledge for the first contribution.
