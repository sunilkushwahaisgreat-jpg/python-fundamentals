# Day 11 – Code Quality & Open Source Exploration

This folder contains my Day 11 work focused on improving code quality and
understanding how real open-source projects are structured and maintained.

---

## 📂 Contents

- `code_quality/refactor.py`  
  Refactored Python functions with:
  - better variable naming
  - improved readability
  - proper docstrings
  - edge case handling

- `README.md`  
  Notes from open-source exploration.

## 🔍 Open Source Repository Explored

**Repository:** (write the repo name here)  
**Language:** Python  

### What the project does
- (Briefly describe in 2–3 lines what the project is about)

### What I observed
- Code is organized into small, focused modules
- Functions are well-documented using docstrings
- Issues clearly describe the problem and expected behavior

### One important thing I learned
- Reading other people’s code is essential to understanding good design
- Clear naming and documentation matter as much as logic

## 🎯 Goal of Day 11

- Practice writing clean, maintainable Python code
- Learn how contributors read and improve existing code
- Develop habits required for open-source contributions and GSoC
